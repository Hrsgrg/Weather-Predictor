Features
Predictive Modeling: Utilizes linear regression to predict precipitation based on maximum temperature and historical date information.
Interactive Interface: Users can input date and temperature values to get real-time predictions and visualize weather patterns.
Data Visualization: Presents visualizations, including scatter plots and box plots, to illustrate actual vs. predicted precipitation trends.
Model Performance Metrics: Evaluates model accuracy through metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
